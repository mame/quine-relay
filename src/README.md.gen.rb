### What this is

This is a <%= langs[0] %> program that generates
<%= langs[1] %> program that generates
<%= langs[2] %> program that generates
...(through <%= langs.size %> languages)...
<%= langs[-1] %> program that generates
the original <%= langs[0] %> code again.

![Language Uroboros][langs]

[langs]: https://raw.github.com/mame/quine-relay/master/langs.png

### Usage

#### 1. Install all interpreters/compilers.

You are fortunate if you are using Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail).
You just have to type the following apt-get command to install all of them.

    $ <%= apts %>

If you are not using Ubuntu, please find your way yourself.
If you could do it, please let me know.  Good luck.

#### 2. Run each program on each interpreter/compiler.

% cmds.each do |cmd|
    $ <%= cmd %>
% end

You will see that `QR.rb` is the same as `QR2.rb`.

    $ diff QR.rb QR2.rb

Alternatively, just type `make`.

    $ make

### Tested interpreter/compiler versions

As I said above, I tested the program on Ubuntu.
It does not provide Unlambda and Whitespace interpreters,
so this repository includes my own implementations.
For other languages, I used the following deb packages:

% rows.each do |row|
<%= row %>
% end

### How to re-generate the source

    $ cd src
    $ rake
